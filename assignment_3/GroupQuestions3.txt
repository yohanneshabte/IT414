1)Does not follow single responsiblity principle. The Quiz class is responsible for almost everything involved in the program, and contains all the functions for formating and presenting the questions.

2)The QuizQuestions class currently can only have 4 answers, no more, no less. Currently, it wouldn't be possible to implement a question with more or less answers.

3)The TrueFalseQuestions class violates liscofs principle, since it is inheriting from quizquestions but does not utilize the class correctly. They should be refactored into a base question class and then create a multiple choice class and a true and false class.

4)The Format Function tries to access answer3 & answer4, but when it encounters a trueFalseQuestion, it breaks because they do not contain those. The question classes should be reformated to contain questions in a list so all the format function has to do is go through the list. This way it can allow questions of all sizes.

5)The CorrectAnswer currently takes a string, so if answers are changed later on, the correct answer will remain the same. Instead it should reference the correct answer directly and grab the string from that.

6)An Interface should be implemented for adding questions into ther quiz instead of questions being added directly though code. Perhaps a function that will construct a list of questions of a requested size, and then the user goes through the list defining the type of question, the question string, number of answers, and then answer strings.
